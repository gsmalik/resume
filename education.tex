	\textit{Using reinforcement based learning techniques to design interconnect overlays for distributed heterogeneous computing}
	\vspace{2ex}
	
	-- My PhD work focuses on leveraging reinforcement based learning and its various flavours to design application specific interconnect overlays, like networks on chips, for reconfigurable heterogeneous computing architectures like Field Programmable Gate Arrays. My focus is on investigating if such reinforcement based techniques can outperform traditional design and compilation methods by learning and exploiting features of interest in the design space of said network overlays.
